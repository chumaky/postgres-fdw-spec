create_foreign_table:
  filename:
    required: conditional
    data_type: string
    description: >
      Specifies the file to be read.
      Relative paths are relative to the data directory.
      Either filename or program must be specified, but not both.
  program:
    required: conditional
    data_type: string
    description: >
      Specifies the command to be executed.
      The standard output of this command will be read as though COPY FROM PROGRAM were used.
      Either program or filename must be specified, but not both.
  format:
    required: false
    data_type: string
    description: >
      Specifies the data format, the same as COPY's FORMAT option.
  header:
    required: false
    data_type: boolean
    description: >
      Specifies whether the data has a header line, the same as COPY's HEADER option.
  delimiter:
    required: false
    data_type: string
    description: >
      Specifies the data delimiter character, the same as COPY's DELIMITER option.
  quote:
    required: false
    data_type: string
    description: >
      Specifies the data quote character, the same as COPY's QUOTE option.
  escape:
    required: false
    data_type: string
    description: >
      Specifies the data escape character, the same as COPY's ESCAPE option.
  null:
    required: false
    data_type: string
    description: >
      Specifies the data null string, the same as COPY's NULL option.
  encoding:
    required: false
    data_type: string
    description: >
      Specifies the data encoding, the same as COPY's ENCODING option.


foreign_table_column:
  force_not_null:
    required: false
    data_type: boolean
    description: >
      If true, it specifies that values of the column should not be matched against the null string (that is, the table-level null option). 
      This has the same effect as listing the column in COPY's FORCE_NOT_NULL option.
  force_null:
    required: false
    data_type: boolean
    description: >
      If true, it specifies that values of the column which match the null string are returned as NULL even if the value is quoted. 
      Without this option, only unquoted values matching the null string are returned as NULL. 
      This has the same effect as listing the column in COPY's FORCE_NULL option.
